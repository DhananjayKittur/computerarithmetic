
i. Checking Overflow
	- Both are negative and negative: end result should be negative but is positive
	- Both are positive and positive and end result should be positive but is negative
	
ii. Checking Underflow
	â€“ detected when during the left shift the exponent E = 1 and the significand
		not normalized
	- set underflow flag, set result exponent to E = 0
Does underflow ever occurs in Floating point multiplication ?

iii. Can Exponent be 0. Yes that is -127.
iv. Can Significant be 0. Yes that is 1.00000
